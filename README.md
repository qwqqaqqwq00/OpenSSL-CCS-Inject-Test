OpenSSL CCS Inject Test
=======================

This script is designed for detection of vulnerable servers (CVE-2014-0224.)  in a wide range of configurations.  It attempts to negotiate using each affected protocol version (SSLv3, TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2) advertising a comprehensive set of ciphers.

Changes:

v0.1 - Updated receive buffer sizes to account for longer certificate messages

v0.2 - Updated record processing to recognize closure alert when included in the same segment as another TLS record

v0.3 - Revised wording to clarify tool output and updated logic to properly recognize session termination outside of standard RFC2246 

changed here: use python3 syntax
